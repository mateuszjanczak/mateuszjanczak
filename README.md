### Hello, I'm Mateusz Janczak 🥷 Software Engineer from Cracow in Poland! 💻

I have been working in the fantastic Schibsted Payment team 🫶 for three years as a Backend Developer. We develop internal product - [Payment Gateway](https://www.schibsted.pl/news/payment-gateway-team/) 💰 that connects Scandinavian payment providers with Schibsted news media brands 📰. Additionally, I have graduated from engineering studies in the field of computer science 🎓 with a bachelor's degree.

I develop software/infrastructure 🔧 using: 

* Java / Kotlin / Arrow-KT
* Spring Boot / Ktor
* Maven / Gradle
* Apache Kafka
* Elasticsearch / NoSQL
* MySQL / PostgreSQL
* Javascript / Typescript
* Docker / Kubernetes
* Serverless / Terraform
* Grafana / Prometheus
* Github Actions / Travis
* Amazon Web Services (AWS)


but the most important skills in software development are agnostic to programming language, so I am familiar with the following areas: 

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Functional Programming (FP)
* SOLID / Clean Code / Design patterns
* Domain Driven Design (DDD)
* Software System Design
* CQRS / Event Sourcing
* Event Driven/Microservices Architecture
* Clean/Onion/Hexagonal Architecture
* Test/Behavior Driven Development (TDD/BDD)
* Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD)
* Monitoring and Reliability
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

In my spare time, I improve my skills as a programmer 🧑‍💻 (because it's a never-ending process) and also practice flying FPV sports drones 🚁
